This is a JavaScript learning repository based on coursework from the Mozilla Developer Network: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

These are my own individually completed assignments following the lesson instructions. Each lesson project has its own folder in the main repository. See the file descriptions for links to the specific lessons they are based on.
